# Welcome

Welcome to my repository for an automated artist commissioning tool.

## Terms of Service (Effective June 27, 2025)

1. By using this tool, you agree to these terms of service.
2. This is an **unmaintained** tool that runs locally on your own PC. If it does not work, please do not contact the developer, as no support will be provided.
3. This tool may stop working in the future if the art commission platform changes.
4. This tool is intended solely for automatically sending commission requests to artists. Do not use it for any other purpose.
5. This is an outdated tool, shared for free, as it no longer requires the developer’s backend server to function.
6. This tool works by automatically checking the website, which may not be approved by the platform. Although it is currently undetectable, using it may violate the platform’s terms of service and could result in account suspension. The developer is not liable for any such suspension, and you accept this risk by using the tool.
7. This tool only includes an installer for Windows.
